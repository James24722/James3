<h1>Favorite subjects</h1>
	<p>My favorite subjects are English, IT, and PE. It's interesting. I can learn a lot from it. English is now an international language as it is used by almost every country in the world. If you want to do business with foreigners, you must learn English because most of them speak and write in English. If you want to learn IT, you must be proficient in English. If you know English, you can also better understand people from other countries. I like sports because I can keep fit</p>
<h1>Expand strengths & reduce weaknesses</h1>
	<p>Personal advantage is the magic weapon for our job search and employment success. We need to find out what makes us different, form a clear self-positioning, and understand our own weaknesses. When applying for a job, we can avoid emergencies that are not handled properly due to our own shortcomings, resulting in unnecessary misunderstandings by employers. Therefore, for your own shortcomings, you should always prescribe the right medicine and try to correct them.</p>
