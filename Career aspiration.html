<h1>Values and methodology </h1>
Project management is very important to organizations and teams, but in order to make it truly effective, it is necessary to ensure that the project management approach is properly mapped to team type, project, organization, and goals
According to the cost, budget and time of our team, we do not choose the waterfall method, we choose the iterative method, and it is expected to go through 3 rounds of planning, design, development, and launch.
The values of IT projects are to consistently deliver results, reduce costs, increase efficiency, and complete IT projects through a number of methods. The strong commitment of the entire organization to project management yields short-term business value.
